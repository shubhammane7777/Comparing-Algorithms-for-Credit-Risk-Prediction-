# Credit Risk Prediction: Comparison of Algorithms

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that compares multiple machine learning algorithms for **credit risk prediction**. The goal is to evaluate different classification models and identify which performs best in predicting whether a loan applicant is likely to default.

## üöÄ Project Overview
Credit risk assessment is one of the most critical tasks in the financial industry. Traditional methods often fail to capture complex patterns in borrower data.  
This project applies and compares different machine learning algorithms to predict credit risk, focusing on **accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC score**.

## üìä Dataset
The dataset consists of borrower information and loan status (good/bad credit).  
Typical features include:
- Age, Income, Employment Status  
- Credit History, Loan Amount, Duration  
- Other financial/behavioral attributes
